# ToDo App - Basic React Native Project

### Description
This is a basic **React Native** project developed as a part of my learning journey. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of React Native, including the use of React Hooks for state management, effect handling, component referencing along with adding splash screen, building a simple user interface and persisting data using AsyncStorage.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: A framework for building native apps
- **JavaScript**: For logic and component development
- **React Hooks**: For state management (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- **AsyncStorage**: For data persistence across sessions
